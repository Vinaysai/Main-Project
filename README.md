# Main-Project.
This application is developed using eclipse IDE. Using Hibernate Framework developer no need to create table in DB, Hibernate framework will take care about creating table. Just developer need to configure DB schema details like username, password, URL (DB TNS entry) and Driver name in the configuration file, named as hibernate.cfg.xml file. and we need to create mapping file with java entity class to Table name and entity properties names to table column names.
i.e, mapping object oriented data to relational data.
